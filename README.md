## The Problem

In a country of over a billion people, countless talented athletes, especially in remote and rural areas, lack the opportunity to be seen. Traditional talent scouting is often limited by geography, resources, and human bias, leaving a vast pool of potential undiscovered. The absence of a standardized, scalable assessment model creates a barrier to entry for deserving athletes.

## Our Solution

**Project Ekalavya** transforms any smartphone into a portable, AI-powered sports science lab. We provide an objective, data-driven platform that empowers athletes to test their abilities, allows coaches to verify their performance, and connects them with a national network of scouts and the Sports Authority of India (SAI).

## ✨ Core Features

* **🏃‍♂️ AI-Powered Physical Testing:** Athletes use their phone's camera to perform standardized tests. Our on-device AI analyzes the video in real-time to provide validated performance metrics.
* **📈 Coach-Verified Game Stats:** A simple, trusted interface for official coaches and referees to log and verify in-game performance, adding a layer of real-world credibility.
* **🔭 Scout Discovery Portal:** A future web platform for scouts to discover, filter, and connect with athletes based on a rich, multi-faceted, and verified dataset.
* **🔒 Secure SAI Data Submission:** A secure, automated pipeline to transmit verified athlete data directly to the Sports Authority of India, integrating with the national sports ecosystem.
